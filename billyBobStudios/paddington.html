                    <h1>Paddington, the Student Loan Debt Management Tool</h1>
                    <p>The final project of our class was the financial app, Paddington. This was an interesting
                        in that it was primarily coding based. For Paddington, we decided to follow the LEAN Model of AGILE
                        and work within certain constraints. This project was created with Nichelle, Gaby, Paulina, and Merritt.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="researchSect">
                        <h1>Diving In</h1>
                        <p>Because of the time constraints and usage of the LEAN Model, we jumped right into creating user personas and a journey map.
                        </p>
                        <div class="persona"></div>
                        <div class="persona2"></div>
                        <p>
                            Both Audrey and Devan provided great insights and a compass for us to follow throughout the design.
                            However, Devan's financial situation was what influenced the numbers part of the app the most.
                        </p>
                        <div class="journey"></div>
                        <h1>Devan's Emotional Journey</h1>
                        <p>
                            After creating Audrey and Devan, we created the final part of our pre-design phase, the journey map.
                            Here we follow them on their ups and downs in order to discover where Paddington can help them.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Wireframing</h1>
                        <p>Due to the time constraints, we decided to jump right into low-res wireframes, rather than paper wireframes.
                            We made this decision in order to be able to test them more quickly.
                        </p>
                        <div class="twoPics">
                            <div class="wireFrames1"></div>
                            <div class="wireFrames2"></div>
                        </div> 
                        <h1>Testing and Iteration</h1>
                        <p>With the low-res wireframes completed, we tested and recieved some great insights.
                           After the first round of insights, we quickly iterated. By this time though, the style guide was completed,
                           so we applied that to our 2nd round wireframes.
                        </p>
                        <div class="styleGuide"></div>
                        <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
                        <p>
                            Now that the wireframes and style guide were paired together, we had high-res comps to test.
                            This was done by A/B testing 5 users, 3 men and 2 women.
                        </p>
                        <div class="twoPics">
                            <div class="wireFrames3"></div>

                        <p>
                            The A/B Testing produced some great feedback and the designs were well recieved.
                            <ul>The biggest takeaways from the testing were:<br><br>
                                <li><strong>The Pig Logo was Not Intuitive</strong> <br>
                                    The pig logo did not read as a homepage for many. Most users thought it was a <br>
                                    piggy bank and thus for money.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>Users Did Not Want to Put in Their Age</strong> <br>
                                    Most users did not like having to put their age in, and did not see what the purpose was. <br>
                                    They wanted to only stick to the relevant information regarding the loans
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>Sleek Sliders</strong> <br>
                                    Most users preferred the thinner sliders and liked seeing 
                                    the numbers change on the side
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <br>
                        <h1>Coding the High-Res Comps</h1>
                        <p>With the testing completed, we quickly finished our high res comps and got to coding.
                            The following link will take you to the live version of the Paddington App. <br>
                            <strong>Please Note:</strong> Due to the way the app was coded, you will have to open the console (by pressing the F12 key)
                            and shrinking the site down to 375x667 dimensions. If you're browsing on mobile, you will see it as intended.

                        <h1>Reflections for the Next Sprint</h1>
                        <p>The Paddington App was my favorite project of the semester, due to it being so code heavy. I am very pleased
                            with the end result and using the LEAN Method was very interesting because we had to prioritize what research to
                            do and what to create.
                           <br>
                           <ul>If we had time for another sprint we would have changed the following:<br><br>
                            <li><strong>Different Coding Languages</strong> <br>
                                Currently, the app is coded with HTML, CSS, and javaScript. <br>
                                However, this makes it harder to test when on a desktop, so I would <br>
                                have liked to have created it with AngularJS, or a similar framework.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>More Accurate Coding</strong> <br>
                                Because some of the designs were more difficult to code than others,<br> we had 
                                to change certain elements in the final version. With more time, <br>
                                I would have liked to have coded the app to look 100% like the final comps.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>To Have Been There From the Beginning</strong> <br>
                                Due to an unforseeable event, I was moved to this group halfway through. <br>
                                I would have liked to have done more in the research and testing phases.
