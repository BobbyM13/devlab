                    <h1>Crave, the Food Recommendation App</h1>
                    <p>Crave is the food app centered around recommendations created from your eating habits
                        and those of your friends and family. And was created in conjunction with Misha and Danny.
                    </p>

                        <h1>Discovering the Problem</h1>
                        <p>Before we could even form a hypothesis, we had to find out people's habits.
                            This was done by interviewing 3 people. and sending out surveys. (36 results)
                        </p>
                        <div class="results1"></div>

                        <h1>I've got a problem...statement</h1>
                        <p>After analyzing the research and looking at the trends, we arrived at the following conclusion.</p>
                        <div class="problem"></div>
                        <h1>Trent Moore</h1>
                        <p>Once we had a problem statement, our next step was to create a persona, this would anchor us and 
                            ensure that we always designed with the end-user in mind.
                        </p>
                        <div class="trent"></div>
                        <h1>What is Trent Thinking?</h1>
                        <p>After creating Trent, we wanted to empathize with him even further. To get into his mind, his thoughts,
                            and his shoes. This empathy map ties in closely with our Journey Map a little later.
                        </p>
                        <div class="trentEmpath"></div>
                        <h1>What is Trent Feeling and Doing?</h1>
                        <p>The next step in the process was visualizng Trent's feelings and his struggles.</p>
                        <div class="trentStory"></div>
                        <h1>Trent's Journey</h1>
                        <p>Combining the storyboard and empathy map, we created the Journey Map, tapping even further into
                            the emotions Trent feels along the way.
                        </p>
                        <div class="trentJourney"></div>
                        <h1>It's Design Time</h1>
                        <p>With a clear vision of Trent in our mind and a solid foundation of research, we finally
                            began the design phase of the project, starting with the User Flow.
                        </p>
                        <div class="trentFlow"></div>
                        <h1>First round of Wireframes</h1>
                        <p>With the user flow charted out, we now had a clear plan of action and created what we thought were the
                            perfect amount of wireframes...
                        </p>
                        <div class="trentFrames1"></div>
                        <h1>Testing our designs and our assumptions</h1>
                        <p>Armed with these new wireframes, we moved to one of the most crucial phases, testing. Because of Trent's age,
                            career, and location, we decided to find people that most fit his description at the local coffee shop.
                            We were able to test on 5 people, 3 females and 2 males. <br>
                            <ul>From this round of testing we discovered 3 key insights: <br><br>
                                <li><strong>The Flow was Intuitive</strong> <br>
                                    All of the testers found the flow easy to use and didn't have struggle at all.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>They Enjoyed the Features</strong> <br>
                                    All of the testers liked the wait time feature and the friend's recommendations section</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>We Needed Filters</strong> <br>
                                    Most of the testers requested this feature for accessability reasons as well as to help 
                                    <br>them pick a food based on thier mood.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this round of testing, we utilized the feedback and iterated on our wiresframes.</p>
                        <div class="trentFrames2"></div>
                        <p>From the initial 4 wiresframes, we ended up adding 3 more for a total of 7.
                            The additional three frames were to showcase the new filter options.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now that we had researched, designed, tested, and iterated, we had finally reached the 
                            high res comps phase of the project.

                        <h1>Reflections and What We'd Do Next</h1>
                        <p>Having completed the 3 high res comps for our user flows, we reached the end of our two week sprint.
                           Based on our testing and feedback, we believe that our project was a success and would solve Trent's problem
                           if we were to make this app.
                           <br>
                           <ul>If we had time for another sprint we would have changed the following:<br><br>
                            <li><strong>More Rounds of Testing</strong> <br>
                                Our testing was done in the wireframes stage and going forward we would test <br>
                                our high res comps to get even more feedback and improve the flows.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>Adding a Second Persona</strong> <br>
                                Our designs, journey, flow, and storyboard were all created based around Trent Moore. <br>
                                However, if we had more time I would have liked to have added another persona, <br>
                                perhaps a female with different needs and goals from the app.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        This would conclude our first project in class and our first experience working in the AGILE model <br>
                        as well as using the double diamond to inform our decisions.
