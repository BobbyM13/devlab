                    <h1>Amazon Redesign</h1>
                    <p>Our second project was to take an existing e-commerce brand and apply UX principles
                        to solve user's problems. We did this through exstensive research and testing.
                        This project was made in collaboration with Misha, Merritt, and Darsh
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="researchSect">
                        <h1>Analyzing Amazon's Existing Flow</h1>
                        <p>Before we conducted surveys and interviews, we first did a SWOT Analysis to determine the 
                            strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to Amazon.
                        </p>
                        <div class="swat"></div>
                        <p>Our biggest take-aways from this were that the existing Amazon experience had some flaws in the filtering options
                           and the navigation menu.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Studying the Navigation</h1>
                        <p>After doing the SWOT analysis, we decided to analyze the way a user would interact with Amazon if they didn't know
                            what they wanted and were using the menu.
                        </p>
                        <div class="navigationFlow"></div>
                        <p>Analyzing the navigation flow really highlighted for us just how much of an opportunity the filters were.
                            Many pages had inconsistant filter options between similar products, such as only showing 2 color options for paint,
                            or showing the price filter in a horizontal bar but the other prices on a vertical bar.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Honing in on the Features</h1>
                        <p>Having now completed a SWOT Analysis and Navigation Flow Analysis, we had a clearer idea of how to proceed.
                           We then created a Feature Benefit Matrix to help visualize our hypothesis.
                        </p>
                        <div class="fbm"></div>
                        <h1>Sending out the Surveys</h1>
                        <p>The next step in the research phase was the surveys. We created a survey with 13 questions and sent it out. We recieved 28 responses
                            which confirmed our hypothesis but also provided some surprising insights.
                        </p>
                        <div class="twoPics">
                            <div class="results1"></div>
                            <div class="results2"></div>
                        </div> 
                        <h1>Interviews</h1>
                        <p>After receiving the survey results, we interviewed 3 people in the average demographic.
                            Below are some of their quotes about their shopping habits and Amazon in general.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Usually the search is enough to get me to where I’m going.”
                                <br><br>
                            </li>
                            <li>“The site just feels cluttered and busy, I feel trapped when I shop.”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>The responses also lined up with the survey results, showing that people mostly use the search bar and
                            also feel that the current Amazon flow is "cluttered."
                        </p>
                        <h1>The Persona Touch</h1>
                        <p>All of the research lead us to a clear vision of our end-user, Kelly Morgan.
                        </p>
                        <div class="persona"></div>
                        <h1>What is Kelly Thinking?</h1>
                        <p>After creating Kelly, we wanted to empathize with her even further. To this end, we created an Empathy Map 
                            to really get into her mindset.
                        </p>
                        <div class="empath"></div>
                        <h1>Kelly's Story - Visualized</h1>
                        <p>The next step was to create a storyboard of how Kelly currently interacts with Amazon, to further empathize with her.</p>
                        <div class="story"></div>
                        <h1>Kelly's Journey</h1>
                        <p>The journey map we made for Kelly helped us be able to keep track of her emotions during the process, as well as 
                            opportunities where our design could help her.
                        </p>
                        <div class="journey"></div>
                        <h1>Our Problem Statement</h1>
                        <p>We believe that navigating the Amazon website is a challenge for consumers because of information overload, particularly overload of irrelevant information.
                           <br><br>Eliminating unnecessary information while focusing on the relevant information may solve this problem so users can avoid information overload during their journey while also helping Amazon establish credibility and trust and strengthen relationships with consumers post-purchase.
                           <br><br>We will know we have succeed when 80% of our customers have rated the shopping experience on Amazon as satisfactory and have increased our customer retention rate by 10%.                                 
                        </p>
                        <h1>Beginning the Design Phase</h1>
                        <p>With the user flow charted out, we now had a clear plan of action and created what we thought were the
                            perfect amount of wireframes...
                        </p>
                        <div class="wireFrames1"></div>
                        <h1>Testing our designs and our assumptions</h1>
                        <p>With the first round of wireframes done, we set out to test over 2 days. To this end, we went to the
                           Austin Public Library on Saturday and Radio Coffee on Sunday, with iteration between.
                        </p>
                            <ul>From this round of testing we discovered 3 key insights: <br><br>
                                <li><strong>People Don't Like Pop-Up Modals</strong> <br>
                                    All of the testers except one expressed dislike for a pop-up error modal, they would prefer <br>to see that on the page or highlighted with color.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>They Preferred Sign-In Buttons and Labels</strong> <br>
                                    The Majority of the testers also preferred a button that says "Sign In" rather than an icon <br>of a person. They also 
                                    said that if there were icons, they'd want them to have <br>labels underneath so they could easily identify what they represent.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>They Liked the Filter Options</strong> <br>
                                    All of the testers found the way the filters work was intuitive. Limiting the choices on <br>
                                    the search page, and having some filters be on the product page itself.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                        <p>After this round of testing, we utilized the feedback and iterated on our wiresframes.</p>
                        <div class="wireFrames2"></div>
                        <p>We quickly iterated and made changes based on the feedback we got from Saturday and tested again on Sunday.
                        </p>
                        <div class="testNotes"></div>
                        <p>
                            Above are some of the notes we took from Sunday's tests, these provide similar feedback as Saturday, so we
                            knew we were on the right track.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Creating the Style Guide</h1>
                        <p>Now that we had researched, designed, tested, and iterated, we were finally ready to start designing. We set
                            forth and made a style guide to keep our designs consistant across the group.
                        </p>
                        <div class="styleGuide"></div>
                        <h1>3 Flows to Rule Them</h1>
                        <p>With the style guide finalized, we started designing the three flows. Sign-In, Purchase, and Error/Payment.
                        </p>
                        <div class="hiFlow1"></div>
                        <div class="hiFlow2"></div>
                        <div class="hiFlow3"></div>
                        <h1>Reflections for the Next Sprint</h1>
                        <p>Having completed the three high-res comps, and presenting it to the class, we were now done with this sprint.
                            Overall, we felt it was a successful solution based on data and user's needs. However, there is always room to
                            improve.</p>
                           <br>
                           <ul>If we had time for another sprint we would have changed the following:<br><br>
                            <li><strong>More Rounds of Testing</strong> <br>
                                Our testing was done in the wireframes stage and going forward we would test <br>
                                our high res comps to get even more feedback and improve the flows.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>Refine the Style Guide a Bit More</strong> <br>
                                Our style guide succeeded at making the designs look cohesive and went <br>
                                into details such as box-shadows being "X: 2, Y: 2, Blur: 8, and Color: rgb(51,51,51)" <br>
                                but I would have liked to have created more detailed components <br>
                                and perhaps even more shades of colors.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>A Coded/Developed MVP</strong> <br>
                                For the deliverables, we only made hi-res comps in jpeg/png form. <br>
                                However, I would have liked to have made a working prototpye in <br>
                                HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        This project gave us a greater understanding of just how much work goes into e-commerce <br>websites,
                        there are so many moving parts that you could spend years just testing what already <br>exists. Going forward,
                        I would love the opportunity to work on the development of an <br>e-commerce site to see how it comes together
                        on the front-end and back-end.
